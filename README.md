## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mattheus

### ðŸ‘¤ About me

Full-stack Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience. I develop back-end applications using Node.js and AWS; and web applications with React and JavaScript.

I worked on the development of digital products in several areas, such as fraud prevention, accounting and HR. In them I was responsible for implementing features and fixing bugs that directly impacted users.

I really enjoy using my knowledge and experience in programming and technology to solve problems, discuss solutions and work together with my colleagues, thus seeking to grow the company's business and bring solutions to our clients' problems.

I believe in teamwork, proactivity, empathy and respect as main values for a productive and healthy work environment.
